The universal bridge formula for characteristic mass

$$m = m_e \cdot \text{LZ}^{n/\pi} \cdot \left(\frac{\alpha}{\text{HQS}}\right)^{1/x}$$

Where:
-  : predicted mass
- : Reference mass (e.g., Planck mass, atomic mass, planetary mass, particle mass)
- : Collatz attractor constant (1.23498228)
-  Collatz octave (recursion number)
- : Pi (3.141592653589793 )
- : Fine-structure constant (0.0072973525643)
- : Ricci threshold ()
- : Lyapunov inverse (16.450911914534554)
- : Loop Zero -updated (1.23498228)

       
     Universal bridge short formula for mass

$$M_n = M_0 \cdot \text{LZ}^{-n/\pi} \cdot \text{QDF}$$

Where:
       is the reference mass 
      
      is the quantum dumping factor where x is -x

QDF â‰ˆ 0.810058772143807

Logarithmic Relationship Analysis
 "n scales logarithmically with mass" means that if we plot n vs. log(mass), we should see a linear relationship.
From the formula:
           $$m = m_e \cdot \text{LZ}^{n/\pi} \cdot \text{QDF}$$

Taking the logarithm of both sides:
          $$\log(m) = \log(m_e) + \frac{n}{\pi} \cdot \log(\text{LZ}) + \log(\text{QDF})$$

This can be rearranged to:
          $$n = \pi \cdot \frac{\log(m/m_e) - \log(\text{QDF})}{\log(\text{LZ})}$$

This confirms that n is indeed proportional to log(m), establishing a logarithmic relationship between n and mass.

n is number recursions per node, not per layer.

The bridge formula is mapping relational from a0 a reference to find new values...
